"Uh, okay, put your hands up, this the anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, butt on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the can you tell me? Smell me?
African American Individual, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone"
